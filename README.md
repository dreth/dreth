## Hi! Welcome! 🎈

### ✏️ What am I doing now?

At the moment I'm working for [Populate](https://populate.tools) and just finished my master's in statistics for data science at [UC3M](https://uc3m.es). You can take a peek at my [Final master project](https://github.com/dreth/tfm_uc3m). It's a demographic dashboard showing visualizations of Spain's mortality/life expectancy over time.

In my free time I research interesting blockchain/cryptocurrency things, play bass guitar, tinker with operating systems and occasionally play videogames.
